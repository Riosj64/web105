                <h2>Guadalajara</h2>
                <p>Guadalajara is a metropolis in western Mexico and the capital of the state of Jalisco in which the
                    city has a population
                    of 1,460,148. Also the Guadalajara metropolitan area has a population of 5,002,466, making it the
                    second-largest
                    metropolitan area in the country.
                </p>
                <p>This is also where my grandparents, from my dad's side of the family, lives and own their own
                    restaurant.</p>
                <p>My cousin, sister, and I came here one summer vacation to visit and explore the place where my dad
                    grew up in.

            <h2>Mexico</h2>
            <p> I have only once left the states and that was when my cousin, sister, and I decided to go
                and visit Mexico a few years back. </p>
            <p>During this 2 week stay in Mexico, one of the places we visited was Guadalajara. This is where we stayed
                the majority
                of the time since that is where both sides of the family, mom's and dad's, lives.
            </p>
            <img src="mexico.jpg" alt="mexico" id="mexico">
            <p>In Guadalajara we stayed with my dad's parents for a while and got to know the land in which my dad grew
                up.
                We went to the local mall where he got his first job, the middle of the city which is also called the
                square, and
                we also got to meet new family members that I did not know existed.
            </p>
            <p>We also got to meet family members from my mom's side of the family. There we visited their candy shop
                and even went to
                a type of fun house which was popular with kids at the time. We stayed there for about 5 days, but 9 in
                total
                with the other family members we stayed with.
            </p>
            <p>After those 9 days we stayed with my other grandparents who lived in the country side. It was less
                comfortable
                living wise than the house in the city, but it was decent enough for me to stay in. It was still a lot
                of fun and
                I would recommend people to go visit Mexico and have a blast exploring it.
