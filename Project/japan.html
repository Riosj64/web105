                <h2>Tokyo</h2>
                <p>Tokyo is the capital and most populous prefecture of Japan which is located at the head of Tokyo Bay.
                </p>
                <p>This prefecture forms part of the Kant≈ç region on the central Pacific coast of Japan's main island of
                    Honshu.</p>
                <p>Whenever there is a holiday, the inner city of Tokyo is always
                    lit up to the appropriate fit. This can be argued to be the most beautiful
                    place in the world.

            <h2>Japan</h2>
            <p>Japan is an island country in East Asia located in the northwest Pacific Ocean. It is bordered by the Sea
                of Japan to
                the west and extends from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Taiwan in the south.
            </p>
            <p>I have always wanted to go here when I was about 14 years old since one of my
                favorite youtubers went on vacation there and captured amazing footage
                of everywhere he went.
            </p>
            <img src="japan.jpg" alt="japan" id="japan">
            <p>Along with places he went to, he also filmed foods that he ate and clothes that he bought.
                The food in Japan always looked good to me and I always wanted to try japanese noodles.
            </p>
            <p>As given some insight on the box to the right. I specifically want to go to Tokyo
                since that is where, I believe, the most beautiful city is located. There is plenty
                of food, clothes, and entertainment to choose from when in the city.
            </p>
            <p>In Tokyo there lies Akihabara. Formerly known for its computer and device infested city, from buying to
                selling,
                it has now transformed into a hot spot for people who enjoy anime and the likes. I would
                also like to go here to see if people actually dress up in cosplay and while I am
                at it get some merchandise for my cousin (I just recently found out that he likes Dragon Ball Z).
