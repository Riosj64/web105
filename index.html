                <h2>Turku</h2>
                <p>Turku is a city on the
                    southwest coast of Finland at the mouth of the Aura River in the region of Finland Proper.</p>
                <p>As the oldest town in the country, Turku is the most important city in Finland, a status it retained
                    for hundreds of
                    years throughout the centuries under the rule of the Kingdom of Sweden.</p>
                <p>This is one place were I would like to visit in Finland due to its amazing scenery.</p>

            <h2>Finland</h2>
            <p>Finland, officially the Republic of Finland is a Nordic country located in Northern Europe which shares
                land borders
                with Sweden to the west, Russia to the east, and Norway to the north.</p>
            <p>The main reason that I want to go to Finland is to visit an old friend. She is originally from Finland
                but came to America when she was just 5 years old. We first met when we were around 9 years old in
                school and
                became good friends for the two years that we were together. Although she did have to go back to her
                grandparents
                back in Finland I promised her that I would visit her at least one more time.
            </p>
            <img src="finland.jpg" alt="finland" id="finland">
            <p>I heard from many people that Finland is a beautiful place to go to if you had a chance to visit the
                world.
            </p>
            <p>A fun fact about Finland can include that The majority of the population lives in central and
                southern Finland with over 1.5 million people living in the Greater
                Helsinki metropolitan area, which produces a third of the country's GDP </p>

            <p>Other fun facts about Finland can include that In 1809, Finland was annexed by the Russian Empire as the
                autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland, during which Finnish art
                flourished and the idea of future independence began to take hold. Also in 1906, Finland became the
                first European state
                to grant all adult citizens the right to vote, and the first in the world to give all adult citizens the
                right to run
                for public office.</p>
